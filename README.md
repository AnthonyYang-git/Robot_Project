# Secure Shipping Using Robotic Delivery System

In general, price is the key element in shipping, and half of the costs are tied up in last-mile deliveries. The biggest expense here is the human element, so companies, which can cut down on staff costs, will be able to out-price their competitors. Therefore, we expect sooner or later robotic delivery systems will become the norm. However, ensuring security in such a system will be a challenge. In this project, we are expected to design, and implement a cooperative or non-cooperative user authentication system in robot environments for securing shipping method using robot. The proposed system will be deployed on TURTLEBOT3 platform.
